CONSOLIDATE   (short-term → long-term, abstraction)

this project first become a cognitive architecture then becomes better in cosolidation then gets meta-cognition.


research proposal -- skill tracker. the multi-model that has multi-model input and acting has reason about what is has learnt and use it future learning and problem-solving.
