# 🤖 Personalized Companion — HITOMI Architecture

> _Adaptive Interaction · Emotional Understanding · Causal Intelligence_

---

## 🧠 Overview

**HITOMI** is the orchestrator agent powering a **Personalized Companion** designed for adaptive interaction, emotional understanding, and causal reasoning.  
The architecture follows a **Ports & Adapters** (Hexagonal) model — ensuring modularity, transparency, and integration between perception, cognition, and action.

## 🧩 System Architecture
![Hitomi Architecture](./src/mind/assets/images/architecture.png)
Above image is a base architecture. New sub-agents will be added.

### 🔸 Core Concept
The system is divided into **Ports** (interfaces for perception and action) and **Agents** (reasoning and monitoring units).  
HITOMI acts as the **main orchestrator**, coordinating multiple sub-agents to perceive, interpret, and respond intelligently to user states and environmental cues.
